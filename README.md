# Luxen ðŸ‘‹

Luxen is a cutting-edge medtech startup revolutionizing the monitoring of micronutrient diseases through innovative hand-imaging technology and advanced artificial intelligence.

## Our Mission

At Luxen, we're committed to improving global health by providing accessible, non-invasive methods for detecting and monitoring micronutrient deficiencies. Our goal is to empower healthcare providers and individuals with real-time, accurate information about nutritional health.

## Technology

Our platform combines two powerful technologies:

1. **Hand-Imaging**: Using high-resolution imaging of the hand, we capture subtle visual indicators of micronutrient status.
2. **Artificial Intelligence**: Our AI models, including CNN and U-Net architectures, analyze these images to detect and track signs of micronutrient deficiencies.

### Key Components

- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: For image classification and feature extraction
- **U-Net**: Specialized for precise image segmentation, allowing detailed analysis of hand features
- **Segmentation and Object Detection Algorithms**: For isolating and analyzing specific regions of interest in hand images as well as detecting color gradients and ROI size

## Updates and Notifications

We regularly push updates to improve our algorithms and expand our capabilities. To stay informed:

- Watch this repository for the latest changes
- Check for notifications of pushed updates, which will be sent out regularly

## Getting Started

Will be coming out soon, hold tight until then!
